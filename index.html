					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Computers today have a variety of methods for information storage. Compact Disks, Digital Video Disks, Flash Drives, Secure Digital Cards, Hard Disk Drives, and Solid State Drives to name a few. This webpage will serve to inform about the last two items, Hard Disk Drives and Solid State Drives.

							Installing a solid-state drive (SSD), also known as a solid-state disk, into your machine can radically ramp up its speed and reliability.<sup>*</sup><strong> <i class="icon-quote-right"></i></strong>

					</div>
					<p>
						The two most common internal storage technologies are the <a href="#hdd">Hard Disk Drive</a> and the <a href="#ssd">Solid State Drive</a>. Hard Disk Drives are slower, bigger, cheaper devices that typically have a larger capacity than Solid State Drives. Solid State Drives are more expensive, but are smaller and very fast.
					</p>

					<p>
						Why does speed matter? Almost every time you perform an action on your computer, files are retreived from the Hard Drive. The faster the system can access and retreive those files, the faster the requested action is performed.
					</p>

					<p>

						Many factors come into play that affect the speed of a Hard Disk Drive. One of the reasons that SSDs are so much faster than HDDs is that they have no moving parts. Performance in Hard Disk Drives is based on but not limited to:

					<h2>Hard Disk Drives</h2>

						<strong>A Modern Hard Drive</strong>
						<p>
							Hard disk drives store digital information in a relatively permanent form.
						</p>
						<small><a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/hard-disk.htm">from howstuffworks.com</a></small>
					</div>
					<p>
						Hard Disk Drives are made up of a spinning disk which is coated in magnetic material as well as a magnetic head on an actuator arm that is used for reading and writing.
					</p>
					<h3>History </h3>

					<p>
						Hard Disk Drives were introduced in late 1950's and were developed by <a href="http://ibm.com/">IBM</a> in order to calculate sports results for the Olympics.
					</p>
					<h3>Form Factor </h3>
					<p>
						The first standardized size of HDDs were 14" platters. Eventually HDD form factors follow the progression of floppy disk drives and included sizes such as 8", 5.25" 3.5", 2.5", 1.8", 1", and 0.85". Currently, 3.5" and 2.5" inch are the most common sizes for desktops and laptops respectively.
					</p>
					<p>
						The main benefit to disk drives over solid state drives is that they are much cheaper and higher capacity. Today a 3TB hard drive will cost only about $150.00 Canadian, while the capacity of a $150.00 SSD would be around 60-120GB.

					<h2>Solid State Drives</h2>

					<p>
						Solid state drives utilize flash memory rather than spinning magnetic disks in order to store data. Flash memory is much faster than traditional storage methods and upgrading your personal computer from a HDD to an SSD will be the most noticeable difference in responsiveness out of any possible upgrade.
					</p>

						<strong>A PCI Express SSD</strong>
						<p>
							The PCIe-based VeloDrive has the ability to deliver transfer speeds of up to 1GB/s.

					</div>
					<h3>History </h3>

					<p>
						Flash memory has been around since the 1970's but it hasn't existed in the personal computer market for very long. Trends show that the prices on SSDs are decreasing while the capacity continues to grow.
					</p>
					<h3>Form Factor </h3>

					<p>
						SSDs can come in multiple forms. Some forms are like traditional hard disk drives in 2.5" and 3.5" inch form factors, but others come on PCI and PCI express cards and interface directly with the computer's motherboard, rather than through a SATA connector.
					</p>

					<p>
						Pictured on the left is a comparison of 2.5" and 3.5" inch form factors. Typically, SSD's come in the smaller form, and an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OCZ-3-5-Inch-Adaptor-Bracket-OCZACSSDBRKT2/dp/B002I8MUU0">adapter bracket</a> is used in order to place the drive into a standard desktop computer case.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although similar to 2.5" HDDs in size, solid state drives are significantly lighter than their disk spinning counterparts. While weight may not make a big difference in a desktop computer, it is an important factor in the mobility of notebook computers.
