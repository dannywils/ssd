						<strong>Pricing</strong>

							<strong><i class="icon-quote-left"></i></strong>
							As of 2012, SSDs are still more expensive per gigabyte than hard drives but prices for SSDs have fallen substantially in recent months. Whereas hard drives are around $0.10/GB for 3.5", or $0.20 for 2.5", an SSD is about $0.80/GB. This is down from ~$2/GB in early 2012. <sup>*</sup>

						This table from <a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/HDD_vs_SSD">Diffen.com</a> shows a comparison between technical aspects of HDDs and SSDs. As you can see SSDs win in every technical category. Solid state drives are the way of the future, and as prices continue to drop substantially, it will not be too long until Hard Drives are comparible to floppy disks- a way of the past.

						</tr>
						<tr title="HDD vs SSD comparison - Speed">
							<td>Speed:</td>
							<td>HDD has higher latency, longer read/write times, and supports fewer IOPs (input output operations per second) compared to SSD.</td>
							<td>SSD has lower latency, longer read/write times, and supports more IOPs (input output operations per second) compared to HDD.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="HDD vs SSD comparison - Heat, Electricity, Noise">
							<td>Heat, Electricity, Noise:</td>
							<td>Hard disk drives use more electricity to rotate the platters, generating heat and noise.</td>
							<td>Since no such rotation is needed in solid state drives, they use less power and do not generate heat or noise.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="HDD vs SSD comparison - Defragmentation">
							<td>Defragmentation:</td>
							<td>The performance of HDD drives worsens due to fragmentation; therefore, they need to be periodically defragmented.</td>
							<td>SSD drive performance is not impacted by fragmentation. So defragmentation is not necessary.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="HDD vs SSD comparison - Components">
							<td>Components:</td>
							<td>HDD contains moving parts - a motor-driven spindle that holds one or more flat circular disks (called platters) coated with a thin layer of magnetic material. Read-and-write heads are positioned on top of the disks; all this is encased in a metal cas</td>
							<td>SSD has no moving parts; it is essentially a memory chip. It is interconnected, integrated circuits (ICs) with an interface connector.  There are three basic components - controller, cache and capacitor.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="HDD vs SSD comparison - Weight">
							<td>Weight:</td>
							<td>HDDs are heavier than SSD drives.</td>
							<td>SSD drives are lighter than HDD drives because they do not have the rotating disks, spindle and motor.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="HDD vs SSD comparison - Dealing with vibration">
							<td>Dealing with vibration:</td>
							<td>The moving parts of HDDs make them susceptible to crashes and damage due to vibration.</td>
							<td>SSD drives can withstand vibration up to 2000Hz, which is much more than HDD.</td>
